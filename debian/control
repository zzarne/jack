Description: Rip and encode CDs with one command
 Jack has been developed with one main goal: making OGGs (or MP3s)
 without having to worry. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip
 goes unnoticed, e.g. jack compares WAV and OGG file sizes when
 continuing from a previous run. Jack also checks your HD space before
 doing anything (even keeps some MB free).
 .
 Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:
  - it supports different rippers and encoders
  - it is very configurable
  - it doesn't need X
  - it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by cdrdao
  - when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed
    and archived for all tracks, so you can see if something went wrong
  - it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules its
    ripping/encoding processes depending on available space.
  - freedb query, file renaming and id3/ogg-tagging
  - it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have
    been ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want
    to do a freedb query.
  - it can do a freedb query based on OGGs alone, like if you don't
    remember from which CD those OGGs came from.
  - freedb submissions
