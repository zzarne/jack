jack (2.99.7-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed ogg-tagging with respect to GENRE and YEAR. As ogg-
    tagging is performed by default when selecting jack from the
    debian menu, this bug might break the package for quite a lot
    of people, therefore urgency=high to still get it into
    woody (closes: #144717)

    output unexpectedly; (closes: #128642)

    concerning display of Various-Artists CDs (closes: #132962)

    new installations.

jack (2.99.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied current CVS concerning base_dir stuff, so that
    jack can be called from the Debian Menu

    directory yet.
  * Corrected spelling mistake in debian/control (closes: #124769)
  * Fixed tagging of Various-Artists CDs with OGG (closes: #129677)
  * Fixed FreeDB mail submitting (closes: #129247)

  * Applied patches from Martin Michlmayr (closes: #118733)

    python-cddb fails (see #118731). This has to be enabled in the
    user's .jackrc, see README.Debian
  * Changed debian/rules to call /usr/bin/python2.1 instead of just
    python as /usr/bin/python isn't around (This and the previous
    upload 2.99.7-1: closes: #118727)
  * Purged menu entry until jack can set a base dir from where to
    start working
