jack (3.1.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this version, base_dir is no longer set in /etc/jackrc.  The
  reason for this is that there is no standard location for sound or
  media files and users may be surprised to find their files in ~/jack
  (the previous default of base_dir).  jack will now by default put
  the files in the current working directory.  You're welcome to set
  base_dir in ~/.jack3rc (or /etc/jackrc) if you have a more appropriate
  location.

jack (3.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The configuration has changed fundamentally with jack-3.0.0.
  There is now a system-wide configuration file /etc/jackrc and
  the user configuration files have been renamed to ~/.jack3rc.
  Further, jack now has a simple scheme to set options permanently,
  by adding --save to the command-line. This is the preferred way
  to set options, as the syntax of the jackrc file has changed.
  See the commented out options in /etc/jackrc for examples of
  useful options and how to set them.

jack (2.99.9-6) unstable; urgency=low

  jack now features a '--cddb-id' option, which lets you specify a
  freedb CDDB id, even though jack calculates a different one. You
  need to specify an ID3 genre via '-G/--id3-genre' for the freedb
  lookup, too. Note that this option has not been applied or even
  accepted upstream yet and is suspect to change in a later version.

jack (2.99.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Alban Browaeys has pointed out that invalid OGG Vorbis tags are produced
  under certain circumstances.  While the OGG Vorbis specification requires
  that the field contents is encoded in UTF-8, jack up to 2.99.9-1 wrote
  an ASCII string to the field.  This has been fixed in 2.99.9-2.
  Fortunately, you do not have to re-encode your OGG files.  Rather, you
  can use jack's -R (rename) feature to simply update the OGG Vorbis tags.
  A script is supplied which takes care of this automatically.  Simply change
  to the directory you keep your OGG files in, and run the script.  For
  example, if your OGG files are in /media/ogg, you have to do:

    $ cd /media/ogg
    $ /usr/share/doc/jack/fix-vorbis-tags.pl

jack (2.99.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Jack now features an undocumented option to turn off
  cdparanoia's --abort-on-skip option. The option's name is
  --I-swear-I'll-never-give-these-files-to-anyone,-including-hot-babes-TM
  Only use this option (if at all) when you already know that a CD will
  not get ripped OK, as this means that unsuccesful rips will be
  unnoticed. You have been warned and will continue on your own risk.

jack (2.99.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  It is now preferred to specify the vbr_quality rather than a
  bitrate. You can do this by adding vbr_quality = $QUALITY to
  your ~/.jackrc, $QUALITY being an integer from 0 (worst
  quality, smallest files) to 10 (best quality, biggest files)

  Average bitrates for oggenc will be around 70-100 for 0 up to
  300-500 kbit/s for 10. vbr_quality = 5 (the default if you don't
  specify the switch in your ~/.jackrc) will be around 150-170
  kbit/s. Please let me know if you get completely different bit-
  rates so I can tune the default. Note that lame and gogo do
  support this switch, too, but at least lame will have a much
  slimmer bandwidth for the bitrate (from 100-200 kbit/s) than
  oggenc.

  If you want to keep using the bitrate (I've been told that the
  quality would be inferior at the same filesize), you can switch
  the comments in /usr/bin/jack, line 425/426, or add a new helper
  section like helpers['oggenc-local'] = {'type':"encoder"[...]"""}
  to your ~/.jackrc(see end of auto-generated ~/.jackrc for an example)

jack (2.99.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

  base_dir is now set to 'environ['HOME'] + "/jack"' (i.e. ~/jack)
  when a new .jackrc is created. This is in preparation for a jack
  menu item, so that jack does not dump the OGGs in the directory
  you started X from. If you upgrade, nothing should change ATM.

jack (2.99.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Jack-2.99.7 had a new .jackrc layout, you'll have to move your
  old .jackrc elsewhere and tune the newly generated one.

  If jack fails reading the TOC(table of contents) for your
  CD-drive, you can try adding
    toc_prog = "cdda2wav"
  or
    toc_prog = "cdparanoia"
  or simply
    toc_prog = ripper
  manually in your .jackrc.

  But beware, using this is deprecated and should be a last resort.
  In particular, you will lose the ability to rip CDs with data tracks,
  as jack no longer will be able to compare the TOCs!

  Please add to bug-nr. #118731 if you experience problems with
  your CD-drive.
