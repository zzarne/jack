    * Insert a CD, fire up jack:
      $ jack
      Now watch it work. It's fun for a while. After having finished, you have
      the follwing files on your HD: track_01.ogg track_02.ogg, ...,
      track_nn.ogg plusjack.toc, jack.freedb, jack.progress. The last three are
      used to store the state jack is in so it can resume work when
      interrupted.
    * Jack will create a directory called jack-xxxxxxxx for you, there it
      stores all the file for the CD whose id is xxxxxxxx. After a freedb query
      this directory is renamed to something human readable, like "Artist -
      Title".
    * When jack is interrupted, call it again using the same commandline as
      before to resume work, in this case:
      $ jack
    * The WAV files have been deleted. If you want jack to keep them, try
      $ jack -k
    * Now let's try a freedb query:
      $ jack -q
      when succesful the files are now renamed to something more readable and
      have been ID3 tagged accordingly. jack.freedb contains the queried freedb
      entry, the original file has been backed up to jack.freedb.bak.
    * The query failed? Ok, contribute! edit the freedb template:
      $ vi jack.freedb
      Note: the DTITLE should be set to
      Artist / Name Of Album
      or
      Various Artist / Name Of Compilation
      when adding a compilation, use
      Artist - Title Of Track
      for the track titles. Do not delete any lines from the template. Do not
      change the numbers. Yes the TTITLEs start at 0 and end one track too
      early. Read the freedb documentation.
    * now activate the entries:
      $ jack -R
      now the files have been renamed and tagged. Check the names two or three
      times. Typo made? No problem, you can alway undo the file renaming with
       $ jack -u
      Note that the ID3 tags are not undone. Fix the freedb file and again, use
      $ jack -R
      to activate your changes. When you are sure the freedb file is suitable
      for submission, submit it (via e-mail (option -m) or via HTTP POST
      (option --submit). When using the former, sendmail must be installed and
      working on your machine! If you're on a dial-up, you can use the -
      m option to queue submits, provided sendmail is set up accordingly):
      $ jack -m
      or
      $jack --submit
Those were the basics. Now some more advanced examples:
    * All in one: query, rip, encode, cleanup:
      $ jack -Q --remove
    * query any time while working:
      $ jack
      and, from another shell:
      $ jack -d -Q
    * query for unknown OGGs:
      $ jack -q -g track_*.ogg
    * rip from image, first, create the image:
      $ cdrdao read-cd --datafile data.cdr data.toc
      then make OGGs from the image:
      $ jack -f data.toc
more to follow.
