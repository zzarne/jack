<LI>    <B>Q:</B>  I'm compiling python 1.5.2 from source. What modules/options do I
    need to use?
<P>
<B>A:</B>  Use the '--with-threads' flag to configure, and make sure you include
    the termios module (which is disabled by default) by uncommenting
    the line:<BR><TT>

    #termios termios.c       # Steen Lumholt's termios module
</TT><BR>
    in Modules/Setup. Jack 2.x doesn't need the threads any more, but they
are still good to have. Only leave them out if they cause trouble. In general, I recommend activating as many modules as possible so you don't have to
recompile every time a newly installed programm needs another non-default module.

<P>
<LI><B>Q:</B> I can't / don't want to install python-1.5.2. Isn't there a
             way to have jack work with an older version of python?
<P>
    <B>A:</B> There are bugs in the python-1.5.1 modules that prevent jack
             from working flawlessly. From memory, the urllib contained a bug
             which prevented freedb queries from working from behind a proxy.
             The wave module did something stupid, too (it is needed for
             ripping from an image.) If you need neither, try it out and tell
             me what works. Otherwise you may try to replace these modules
             by the ones from the python-1.5.2 version. Again, please tell me
             your experiences.
<P>
<LI><B>Q:</B> Jack is encoding with a different bitrate than specified in .jackrc. Why?
<P>
<B>A:</B>    The bitrate is cached in jack.progress. So if you encode track n with bitrate x1, delete the MP3 and call jack without specifying a bitrate, bitrate x1 is used, regardless what the default in your .jackrc is. Specify the wanted bitrate with -b.
<P>
<LI><B>Q:</B> I want to use a flat local cddb directory. Jack wants me to use subfolders like rock, blues, ... . Can you help?
<P>
<B>A:</B>    As long as nobody complains, use this workaround (sh style):<BR>
cd [your_cddb_dir]<BR>
for i in  blues classical country data folk \<BR>
jazz misc newage reggae rock  soundtrack ; do<BR>
    ln -s . "$i"<BR>
done
