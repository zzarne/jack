##### This is jack 2.2.2 ...
 ### changes from version 2.1.1 (internal) include:
  # added curses frontend
  # added support for variable bitrate MP3s (currently only for lame)
  # bugfix: cddb query disc length was 2 seconds too short (thanks to
            Martin Suess for the hint). I still don't understand where and
            why I need the MSF OFFSET of 150 blocks, can anyone explain?
  # bugfix: freedb files with more than one line of ids confused jack,
            thanks to "casret" for the patch
 ### changes from version 2.1.0 include:
  # moved the toc_proc variable a bit lower in the .jackrc 'coz it's confusing
  # change: in the jack.progress file, track numbers are now %02i
  # bugfix: sometimes the :-) was not updated in case of an error, now it is
  # bugfix: pause works now...
  # bugfix: update interval no longer effects speed on non-Linux (i hope!)
 ### changes from version 2.0.1 include:
  # bugfix: the NameError: cd_device bug is gone (I never saw this as I
            didn't change _my_ .jackrc... sorry)
  # bugfix: same for "... maybe ... is not installed"
  # added on-the-fly operation for cdparanoia, lame, mp3enc
  # added 40 second pause before displaying global ETA so it can stabilize
  # added option to execute user-defined commands - when done without errors
                                                  - when done with    errors
                                                  - when ripping is finished
  # added version check for .jackrc
  # change: "Various" in freedb data is now treated like "Various Artists"
  # added check for bogous DAE run without reported error (by checking filesize)
  # bugfix: ZeroDivisionError when a lonely encoder was killed
  # added better source code formatting :)
 ### changes from version 2.0.0 include:
  # bugfix: jack tried to chdir into newly created dirs twice
  # bugfix: subdirs were created in the wrong sequence
 ### changes from version 1.3.5 include:
  # MANY changes and improvements, let's see if i can remember all:
  # removed all thread and Queue stuff, much less trouble now
  # removed resource control (ulimit), jack now quits gracefully
  # added run-time commands, run jack -h to see details
  # added directory creation and naming
  # added directory auto-search magic, if jack doesn't find a toc-file,
          it scans sub-directories (where and how deep is configurable) for
          a matching toc-file and continues work
  # added base_dir option, controls where new dirs are created. If you set
          your prefs the right way, you only have to change CDs and type
          "jack" from time to time.
  # added no-various option to prevent "Various Artists" auto-detection
  # added option to re-create progress file
  # added update_interval, status is now updated regularily and no longer
          in reaction to sub-process output
  # added total ETA (only for encoders)
  # changed jack so that it should (finally!) run on FreeBSD and most
            other unices
  # performance enhancements, jack only wastes < 0.1 % of _my_ CPU time
 ### changes from version 1.3.4 include:
  # added support for tosha(gettoc&DAE) PLEASE help me get jack to work on
          FreeBSD. Something's wrong with threading I fear.
  # bugfix: jack reported "WAV lost" when the wav was removed on purpose
  # bugfix: jack encoded WAVs when resuming even if only_dae was set
 ### changes from version 1.3.3 include:
  # bugfix: jack reported "wrong disc" in error
  # change: track 1 pregap is now stored in "SILENCE" in tocfile. Re-generate
            your jack.toc files!
 ### changes from version 1.3.2b include:
  # better version of cdrdao_gettoc
  # added resource module auto-detection
