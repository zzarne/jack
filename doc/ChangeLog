	* doc/: ChangeLog, index.html:
	- index.html points to ChageLog instead of CHANGELOG now
	- ChangeLog will contain the more recent changes now, CHANGELOG the
	very old ones. ChangeLog will NOT be up-to date in cvs BUT in
        releases.

2001-11-07 18:43  zarne

	* doc/CHANGELOG: - prepared it for automatic actualization,
	released versions contain the CVS log from now on. CHANGELOG is now
	a template from which ChangeLog is generated when releasing, CVS
        will contain both in a undefined state.

	- works with python2 now, I tested/use 2.1.1

	problems.

        (Bender, you really should not program when you're sober!)

2001-10-06 00:14  zarne

	* README, jack:
	started Ogg Vorbis support which seems to work, there's still a bug
	concerning the ogg info data. I'll try to fix that one later.

2001-08-31 22:27  zarne

	* bumped version to 2.9.5
	* include my patched cursesmodule now, together with a distutils
	installer
	* removed ID3.py, this and CDDB.py must be downloaded and installed
	separately   (instructions included)
	* runs on python2 again, don't know whether it works
        * lots of changes, fixes -- I lost track

2001-03-14 07:32  zarne

	* jack_mp3.py: Why hasn't this been in CVS before??? :]
	- huge performance gain
	- better (more accurate) frame syncing (two consecutive rames are
	searched for now)
	- more robust now
	- VBR bitrates are now returned as a float
	- preliminary ID3v2 support (corrently only the version number is
	extracted and the tag is skipped)
        - new info: bpf and framesize

- better detection of Xing tags

2001-03-14 07:23  zarne

	* ID3.py: - small fixes
	- replaced tabs by spaces
	- this is not a official version now, I will sync this with
        official 1.0 soon.

2001-03-14 07:19  zarne

	* README, jack, doc/INSTALL: - support for freedb files which have
	track title or artist stored in the EXTT fields
	- toc reading for cdparanois disabled because it's incomplete for
	CD EXTRA
	- added support for CDDB.py, available at
	http://cddb-py.sourceforge.net/ (currently only toc reading) this
	is now the default
	- fixed a bug triggered by tocfiles containing quotes on the file
	name
	- added support for EXDD=YEAR:	ID3G, who can tell me who set this
	"standard"?
	- CRs are now ignored in freedb files
	- added "Sampler" and "Diverse" to the list of various artists
	tokens
	- -G none now sets the ID3v1 genre to 255("unknown")
        - print year and genre when finished (if available)

2000-11-21 02:47  zarne

	* jack: *** .jackrc option to disable http_proxy *** replace x -> ×
	for speed factors *** sys.stdin.flush() removed, impossible :-).
	What's the "correct" way to flush stdin? fcntl with O_NONBLOCK,
	then reading (and discarding) until nothing is read? Is there an
	easy way? *** jack.freedb now has as many spaces in front of the
        MSF offsets as your favorite CD player *** some reformatting

2000-11-02 20:27  zarne

	* jack: 1) reformatted helpers{} 2) show_time = 1 and show_names =
	1 are now defaults 3) it's now called 2.99.4 (actually since the
        last commit)

2000-11-02 02:08  zarne

	* jack: 1) renamed id -> cd_id; id is a reserved word in python.
	2) ignore data tracks, tested with cdparanoia only 3) quit if there
	are no audio tracks (to do) 4) --abort-on-skip is now the default
	for cdparanoia, change it if you    don't like it 5) call it 2.99.4
	cosmetic changes: 1) more straighforward displays 2) show_time now
	saves space by reducing track_names to their number.	 Thus the
	"normal" line for a track fits into 80 columns again.  3) Show
	freedb-id and total playing time in Options line 4) try to show
	Options line when exiting
        "do only one change per commit" is for sissies :-).

2000-08-13 20:16  zarne

2000-08-13 20:13  zarne

2000-08-11 00:02  zarne

	* jack: changed the short option for --update-freedb from -u to -U
	because of conflicts. Thanks to C. Marquardt for finding what I do
        when I program late at night :-).

2000-08-09 04:52  zarne

	* ID3.py, jack: jack can now "update", i.e. re-generate freedb
	files (new option -u) updated ID3 module so that it supports
        ID3v1.1 track info jack now sets ID3v1.1 track info

2000-08-08 08:17  zarne
