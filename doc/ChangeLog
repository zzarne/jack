	bug

2002-06-13 05:43  zarne

	* jack.man: 
	
	- -F and -f clarified

2002-06-13 05:37  zarne

	only one track on them. fixed.
	
	- some cleanups

2002-06-09 02:06  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	- only import what we use from the curses module

2002-06-09 01:56  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	- jack can use normal curses now (to the extent possible, i.e.
	without reacting to SIGWINCH (terminal window resizing)) (inspired
	by Oleg Broytmann's patch, thanks!)

2002-06-01 17:03  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* added sloppy ripping mode which is activated by a secret switch

2002-05-25 04:01  zarne

	too.

	* typo

2002-05-25 01:44  zarne

	deprecation warning

2002-05-25 00:56  zarne

	* jack, jack.man: 
	
	* renamed option --rename-only to --rename -- old name was
	confusing. I'll revert this if enough people complain.

2002-05-24 15:51  zarne

2002-05-24 12:12  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* hide --charset option from --help if char_filter is not used.
	having no effect, it would then only confuse people.

2002-05-24 12:10  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* some small cleanups, options reordered
	
	* new char_filter, e.g. for upper->lowercase conversion. should
	work with any character encoding
	
	* new option --charset, see above, default is latin-1

	< 2.2?

2002-05-04 04:55  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* fixed Debian Bug#140903 (replacement_chars doesn't work on
	uppercase umlauts) by documenting it - there's no way to "fix" it
	but the workaround is simple: just add the umlauts explicitly to
	unusable_chars and replacement_chars

2002-05-03 00:03  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* fixed Debian Bug#141781: --upd-progress assumes that the tracks

2002-04-30 01:36  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* Debian Bug#144996 (jack uses ogg tag "YEAR" instead of "DATE")

	people have

2002-04-15 03:27  zarne

	* jack:

	* better defaults for genre and year when pre-tagging

2002-04-15 02:23  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* (re-)enabled correct processing of mixed mode CDs (which have a
	data track 1)

	first track is always numbered 01

2002-04-15 00:32  zarne

	* jack: 
	
	* fixed bugs introduced in rev. 1.42

	* "various" is now a global variable
	
	* on VA CDs the artist is now shown while encoding (thanks to
	Martin Michlmayr)

2002-02-11 03:54  zarne

	* jack: 
	* removed the quality switch for oggenc, people say the default (3)
	is good. In a quick listening test with a difficult CD I could not
	spot any obvious flaws. Ogg Vorbis is impressive.

2002-02-06 20:18  zarne

	* README, jack, jack_CDTime.py, jack_TOC.py, jack_TOCentry.py,

	[0]

	you dme!)

2002-02-03 13:14  zarne

	* jack: 
	* fixed a bug in VA pretagging, thanks to Martin Michlmayr for the
	patch!

2002-02-03 03:48  zarne

	* jack:

	time ;-)
	
	* fixes for local freedb_dir by Matthew Mueller

2002-02-03 03:20  zarne

	True VBR now.
	
	* [ Sorry, I was terribly busy in the recent past. ]
	
	* [ There's still a huge backlog.]

2001-11-12 06:36  zarne

	* jack: 
	- small code cleanup (the category chooser is one function now
	instead of 3 instances)
	
	- freedb category is now remembered, useful for submitting updated
	entries
	
	- bug fixed: entering "0" as category used last category instead of
	aborting

2001-11-09 19:34  zarne

	* jack: 
	- added option --wait (wait on quit)
	
	- added option --workdir (where to put files / dirs, == base_dir)
	
	- added option --search (where to search for workdir, appends to
	searchdirs)
	
	- create all dirs leading to workdir

2001-11-08 19:57  zarne

	* jack: 
	This patch - provided by Martin Michlmayr - does this:
	
	- use float and int instead of atof and atoi.  The latter are
	deprecated (see Python documentation). (The jack_*.py modules need
	to be overhauled likewise)
	
	- Check if an input string is really an integer and don't fail if
	it's not.
	
	- Check the range of tracks in the -t arguments and ignore invalid
	tracks.

2001-11-08 02:22  zarne

	* jack: 
	now that 2.99.7 is out, bump version to 2.99.8

2001-11-07 18:52  zarne

	* doc/: ChangeLog, index.html:

	- ChangeLog will contain the more recent changes now, CHANGELOG the
	very old ones. ChangeLog will NOT be up-to date in cvs BUT in
	releases.

2001-11-07 18:43  zarne

	* doc/CHANGELOG: - prepared it for automatic actualization,
	released versions contain the CVS log from now on. CHANGELOG is now
	a template from which ChangeLog is generated when releasing, CVS
	will contain both in a undefined state.

2001-11-07 18:08  zarne

	- works with python2 now, I tested/use 2.1.1
	
	- tell people what to do if modules are missing

	- tried xtermset again and found that it still works
	
	- try it!

	- compile helpers, this works in python2. comment out if you have
	problems.

	- encoders, rippers and freedb servers are listed if specified
	doesn't exist

	- removed version info from doc/INSTALL because I keep to forget to
	update it

2001-10-10 23:21  zarne

	* jack: - changed http Submit-Mode from test to submit (oops)

2001-10-06 00:14  zarne

	* README, jack: 
	started Ogg Vorbis support which seems to work, there's still a bug

	clarified (I hope) the installation procedure

2001-08-31 06:29  zarne

	ID3 is available separately, the patch was moved into the
	cursesmodule subdir.

	inital checkin. anyone else I forgot?

	* bumped version to 2.9.5

	* runs on python2 again, don't know whether it works
	
	* lots of changes, fixes -- I lost track

2001-03-14 07:32  zarne

	* jack_mp3.py: Why hasn't this been in CVS before??? :]
	
	- huge performance gain
	
	- better (more accurate) frame syncing (two consecutive rames are
	searched for now)
	
	- more robust now
	
	- VBR bitrates are now returned as a float
	
	- preliminary ID3v2 support (corrently only the version number is

	- better detection of Xing tags

2001-03-14 07:23  zarne

2001-03-14 07:19  zarne

	* README, jack, doc/INSTALL: - support for freedb files which have
	track title or artist stored in the EXTT fields
	
	- toc reading for cdparanois disabled because it's incomplete for
	CD EXTRA

	tokens
	
	- -G none now sets the ID3v1 genre to 255("unknown")
	
	- print year and genre when finished (if available)

2000-11-21 02:47  zarne

	* jack: *** .jackrc option to disable http_proxy *** replace x -> ×
	for speed factors *** sys.stdin.flush() removed, impossible :-).
	What's the "correct" way to flush stdin? fcntl with O_NONBLOCK,
	then reading (and discarding) until nothing is read? Is there an
	easy way? *** jack.freedb now has as many spaces in front of the
	MSF offsets as your favorite CD player *** some reformatting

2000-11-02 20:27  zarne

	* jack: 1) reformatted helpers{} 2) show_time = 1 and show_names =
	1 are now defaults 3) it's now called 2.99.4 (actually since the
	last commit)

2000-11-02 02:08  zarne

	* jack: 1) renamed id -> cd_id; id is a reserved word in python. 
	2) ignore data tracks, tested with cdparanoia only 3) quit if there
	are no audio tracks (to do) 4) --abort-on-skip is now the default
	for cdparanoia, change it if you    don't like it 5) call it 2.99.4
	
	cosmetic changes: 1) more straighforward displays 2) show_time now
	saves space by reducing track_names to their number.	 Thus the
	"normal" line for a track fits into 80 columns again.  3) Show
	freedb-id and total playing time in Options line 4) try to show
	Options line when exiting
	
	"do only one change per commit" is for sissies :-).

2000-08-13 20:16  zarne

	* jack: forgot this one in the previous commit

2000-08-13 20:13  zarne

	* ID3.py, jack: jack can now "update", i.e. re-generate freedb
	files (new option -u) updated ID3 module so that it supports
	ID3v1.1 track info jack now sets ID3v1.1 track info
