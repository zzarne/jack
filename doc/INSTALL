uncompress it:
# gunzip jack-*.gz
untar it:
# tar xvf jack-*.tar
change dir:
# cd jack-*
[You are here :] Copy it somewhere in your $PATH, e.g.:
# cp jack* $HOME/bin
or (you may have to be root)
# cp jack* /usr/local/bin

install the ID3 module as it is not yet part of python:
as root:
# cp ID3.py /usr/lib/python1.5
or
# cp ID3.py /usr/local/lib/python1.5

as a normal user:
# cp ID3.py $HOME/bin
# PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
# export PATH

If you want to use the curses mode (belive me, you want to), you have to
install a special cursesmodule. The one which comes with python has no support
for pads.  The improved version from Oliver Andrich is missing the function
resizeterm which I patched in. I mailed the patch to the author so it may be
included in a future version. Get my version on the download page or download
the original cursesmodule from
http://andrich.net/python/selfmade.html#ncursesmodule
and use the patch in this directory (cursesmodule-1.5b2.patch). You can either
compile the module yourself or use the precompiled version which is in my
package. I compiled it on a RedHat 6.0 alike system on an i686. If you want to
(or have to) compile it yourself, try the following if you can't get the
Makefile to work:

# gcc  -g -O2 -I/usr/local/include/python1.5 -I/usr/local/lib/python1.5/config \
# -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c ./cursesmodule.c
# gcc -shared  cursesmodule.o  -lncurses -ltermcap -o cursesmodule.so

Install the cursesmodule.so like you installed the ID3.py module above.

That's it!
