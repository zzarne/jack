--- Step 1 - install 3rd party modules ---------------------------------------

install the ID3.py and CDDB.py module:

* grab them from http://cddb-py.sourceforge.net
  and            http://id3-py.sourceforge.net

Too ease up the installations, install the Python Distutils-SIG
from

    http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/

if you don't already have them. (If you don't have them you'll get errors like
"ImportError: No module named distutils.core".)

* if you have the python distutils installed, simply install them (as root)
  with

    # python setup.py install

* if not, follow the instructions


--- Step 2 - install my curses module ----------------------------------------

* see the end of this file for tips on installing it without distutils!

* if you have the python distutils installed, run (as root if needed)

    # python setup-cursesmodule.py install

--- Step 3 - install jack and it's modules -----------------------------------

Copy it somewhere in your $PATH, e.g.:

    # cp jack* $HOME/bin

or (you may have to be root)

    # cp jack /usr/local/bin/
    # cp jack_*py /usr/local/lib/python1.5/site-packages/

--- That's it -- you're done! Congratulations!

--- help on installing the cursesmodule manually -----------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(some of this is outdated, the module is now called jack_curses)
If you want to use the curses mode (belive me, you want to), you have to
install a special cursesmodule. The one which comes with python has no support
for pads.  The improved version from Oliver Andrich is missing the function
resizeterm which I patched in. I mailed the patch to the author so it may be
included in a future version. Get my version on the download page or download
the original cursesmodule from
http://andrich.net/python/selfmade.html#ncursesmodule (link broken, sorry)
and use the patch in the cursesmodule directory (cursesmodule-1.5b2.patch). You
can either compile the module yourself or use the precompiled version which is
in my package. I compiled it on a RedHat 6.0 (late I added a binary which runs
on Debian Potato) alike system on an i686. If you want to (or have to) compile
it yourself, try the following if you can't get the Makefile to work:

# gcc  -g -O2 -I/usr/local/include/python1.5 -I/usr/local/lib/python1.5/config \
# -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c ./cursesmodule.c
# gcc -shared  cursesmodule.o  -lncurses -ltermcap -o cursesmodule.so

Install the cursesmodule.so to your site-packages.

If you can't get the precompiled cursesmodule to run, make sure that all
needed libraries are installed on you system. Check this with
# ldd cursesmodule.so
which should produce output similar to
        libncurses.so.4 => /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4 (0x40018000)
        libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 (0x4005a000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4005e000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x80000000).
All links must be satisfied; if a library cannot be found, ldd will tell you.
In this case install all missing libraries. Some Linux systems don't install
termcap libraries, fix this; e.g. on RedHat systems, you need
libtermcap-*.rpm.
