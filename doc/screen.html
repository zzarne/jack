(This shows the old 1.3.x version of Jack, 2.x.x look a bit different but nothing major)
<P>
Note that the xterm is automatically resized to fit all the tracks of the CD if you have xtermset installed (and enabled).
<P>
Jack is a console tool, somewhat in the great tradition of command-line oriented software. When using XTerm and xtermset the xterm's size is automagically changed to match the number of tracks.

This is the meaning of the marked elements:
<UL>
<LI>1: the options line: list general options like MP3 bitrate, the WAV read-ahead,...
<LI>2: the DAE speed: how much faster than real-time the audio data has been extracted
<LI>3: the DAE status: actually, this is the output of cdparanoia, check cdparanoia -h for details on the used characters, e.g. a "+" means "Unreported loss of streaming/other error in read".
<LI>4: the encoder status: while encoding, the percentage along with the ETA is displayed, afterwards the speed-factor is given, how much faster (or, like in the exaple, slower) than real-time the encoding was
<LI>5: DAE in progress: the greater-sign indicates how far the extraction of this track has come, again, this is cdparanoia output.
<LI>6: the status line: how much disc-space is left, how many WAVs are waiting to be encoded, how many subprocesses are idle, and, finally, the error status.
</UL>

<H3>Update</H3>
I made another screenshot of the more current version 2.2.0, using curses.
You will be able to understand it if you read above descriptions.
