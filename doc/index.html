<H3>"Why would anyone need <I>another</I> CD ripper / MP3 encoder frontend?"</H3>
If you just need everything that is new, download it <A href="download.html">here</A>. Be sure to read the <A href=requirements.html>system requirements</A>. It's quite likely that you do not have the correct python version.

<TR><TD valign=top>10-Jan-2000
    <TD>New Version (2.99.0-pre) "ain't it dead yet". I'm about to do some major
    restructuring on jack, i.e. breaking it up into modules, so the
    installation has changes slightly. Read INSTALL. Cdparanoia 9.7 is now
    supported, so is xingmp3enc (the latter being untested). You can now use
    a local freedb dir. Yes, all bugs fixed, especially those concerning
    the image-reader. TOC file reading has been completely rewritten, it
    is now 100% bug-free (as if). Please, everybody try this version and
    gimme some feedback.
<TR><TD valign=top>05-Nov-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.5-pre). Still no documentation updates. Fixes
	2.2.4's renaming bug. Doh.
<TR><TD valign=top>04-Nov-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.4-pre). No documentation updates (again). Two bugs
	fixed, one newly introduced. "desperate" mode for those who can't get curses mode to work.
	Jack now has 3333 lines of code.
<TR><TD valign=top>04-Nov-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.3-pre). No documentation updates (again). Reintroduced
	free space checking by calling df for all those (RedHat?) users who
	had an error with statvfs. Whoever built those rpms should be punished.
	rename_underscore has been replaced by something more flexible, now you
	can replace characters by multiple characters (like "&auml;" to "ae"),
	kill characters from the filename to be used and, of course, replace
	those spaces by underlines.
	New DAE tools: cdda2wav (finally!) and dagrab (untested as it doesn't
	like my Plextor). All bug fixed, of course.
<TR><TD valign=top>22-Oct-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.2-pre). If you get an error like
        "AttributeError: TIOCWINSZ", try this version. It is shipped
        with 2.2.0 documentation as I didn't have time to update it yet.
        Changes: all bugs fixed :), new features. Wait for the final version
        for details.
<TR><TD valign=top>19-Aug-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.0). New curses mode, looks much better, scroll
        through the status screen if it doesn't fit in your terminal.
        I recommend not to use XTermset any longer as it is no longer needed.
        The usual bugfixes are there, too, check the
        <A href="CHANGELOG">changelog</A>.
<TR><TD valign=top>18-Aug-1999
    <TD>I really want to add support for the Xing encoder. Does anyone want to pay the registration fee for me? It's only $19 I think.
<TR><TD valign=top>09-Aug-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.1.0), all bugs fixed (of course!), new features like
        on-the-fly operation.
<TR><TD valign=top>19-Jul-1999
    <TD>Big OOPS. Version 2.0.0 contained (at least) two "brown paper bag" bugs:
        first, jack tried to chdir into newly created dirs twice (one time too
        much), this gets you the "could not create or change to..." error.
        Second, the dirs were created in the wrong sequence, so instead
        of "artist/album" you get "album/artist". Upgrade to 2.0.1, get it
        from the <A href="download.html">download page</A>.
<TR><TD valign=top>16-Jul-1999
    <TD>None of the beta testers complained, so I released version 2.0.0.
        Much has changed, most notably I restructured the beast a bit so that
        Jack no longer needs threads. It's now much easier to get it to work.
        Jack should (finally!) run on FreeBSD and most other unices.
        Jack can now create (and name according to freedb data) directories.
<TR><TD valign=top>01-Jul-1999
    <TD>Released version 1.3.5. Support for tosha(gettoc&DAE) has been added,
        a few non-critical bugs have been fixed.
<TR><TD valign=top>29-Jun-1999
    <TD>Released version 1.3.4. Version 1.3.3 contained a bug where it could
        wrongly claim that you inserted the wrong CD if track 01 doesn't start
        at block 0. The TOC file format changed, too, so better have them
        re-generated.
</TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>27-Jun-1999
    <TD>Released version 1.3.3. see the <A href="CHANGELOG">changelog</A> for details
</TR>
<TR><TD>
    <TD>rearranged the pages a bit. I know the layout still sux, if <B>you</B> have time to waste, let me know.

<H3>What's it all about?</H3>
Jack has been developed with one main goal: making MP3s<I> without having to
worry</I>. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip goes unnotices, e.g. jack
compares WAV and MP3 filesizes when continuing from a previous run. Jack also
checks your HD space before doing anything (even keeps some MB free).
<P>
You can take a <A href=screen.html>look</A> at jack working, there are even some explanations.
<P>
Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:
<UL>
<LI>it is written in <A href=http://www.python.org>python</A>

<LI>it is <I>very</I> configurable, maybe too much :)

<LI>it doesn't need X (but is better with it)

<LI>it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by <A
href=http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/cdrdao.html>cdrdao</A>

<LI>when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed for all
tracks, so you can see if something went wrong (I consider this very important
- no one wants uncorrected errors or skips to go into one's MP3s. 'Tis the main
  reason why I don't use something beautiful like <A
href=http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~oliphant/grip/>grip</A>)

<LI>it allows for overlapping ripping / encoding: when the first track has been
ripped, it's encoder is started as well as the second track's ripping process,
this "read-ahead" is of course configurable, you can have it read the whole CD
and start with the next one as the first one is beeing encoded

<LI>in on-the-fly mode, no WAVs have to be created, less space is wasted. I only recommend this if your encoder is nearly as fast as your ripper.

<LI>it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules it's ripping
/ encoding processes depending on available space. Jack tells you if the batch
will not fit on your HD. If you want, you can have it choose the optimal
sequence of tracks - great if you're low on HD space

<LI>freedb query, file renaming and id3 tagging - I know that this alone is not
special, but jack tries hard to recognize artist and title when working on a
"Various Artists"-CD, so that the ID3 tag can be set correctly.

<LI>it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have been
ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want to do a freedb
query. In practice, this means that you can change the CD and start another
instance of jack.

<LI>it can do a freedb query based on MP3s alone, like if you don't remember
from which CD those MP3s came from.

</UL>

Of course, all other "obvious" features are included, too:
<UL>
<LI>being <A href=gpl.txt>GPL</A>'ed

<LI>different rippers and encoders are supported

<LI>freedb submissions

<LI>proxy support via http_proxy environment variable (e.g. export http_proxy=http://cache.sld.tld:3128/)

</UL>
